This is an app to rate songs. When directed to the index.html page, users will be asked to sign in. If they don't have an account, they can sign up via the "sign up" button. After signing up/logging in, users will be directed to the main ratings page. From there, they can view all the ratings, update and delete ratings they submitted, or log out. If they update or delete a rating, they are taken to update and delete pages. The update page shows the rating values currently set and allows the user to change them. The delete page confirms with the user that they would like to delete the rating, and then deletes it.
