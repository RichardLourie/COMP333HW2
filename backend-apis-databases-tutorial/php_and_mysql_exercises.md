## Deploying PHP Scripts

Try deploying the following Hello World PHP script

1. locally (i.e., save the code in a file hello_world.php with the content below
   and load it from your local drive into your browser)
2. on GitHub Pages (i.e., `git push`)

Why does it not work in each of these cases?

```php
  <?php $user = "Patti Smith"; ?>
  <html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
  Hello <?php echo $user; ?>
  </body>
  </html>
```
