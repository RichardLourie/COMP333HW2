  PHP sample script for querying a database with SQL. This script can be run 
  from inside the htdocs directory in XAMPP. 
  
  NOTE: The script assumes that there is a database set up (e.g., via phpMyAdmin) 
  named COMP333_SQL_Tutorial with students and student_grades tables per the 
  sql_tutorial.md.
