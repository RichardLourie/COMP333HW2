## Deploying PHP Scripts

1. Deploying the Hello World PHP script does not work because your browser
   is not a web server; it can only render client-side files.
2. GitHub Pages only allows us to serve static web pages. Their web server
   does not have PHP installed.

   We need some cloud computing or hosting that runs a PHP interpreter on
   its server. For development we can also use a local server with
   PHP, for example via [XAMPP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/).
